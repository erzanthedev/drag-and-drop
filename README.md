# 🖇️ Drag and Drop Project 🖇️

Welcome to my Drag and Drop project! This web-based project management and productivity application, similar to a mini version of Trello, helps individuals and teams organize tasks, projects, and workflows. Using a visual system of boards, lists, and cards, it makes it easy to track progress and collaborate with others.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

I started this project with a CSS template and a bit of JavaScript to quickly build the UI.

## ✨ Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to learn how to implement the Drag and Drop API using JavaScript to achieve the following:

- **Update Local Storage**: Save the state of boards, lists, and cards to local storage.
- **Update DOM**: Dynamically update the DOM based on user interactions.
- **Rebuild and Populate DOM**: Reconstruct and display the boards, lists, and cards from local storage.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement functions to delete, select, add, and update/edit items on the board.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **JavaScript Drag and Drop API**: Gained hands-on experience with the Drag and Drop API to create a smooth, interactive user interface.
- **Local Storage**: Improved skills in using local storage to persist data across sessions.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Enhanced ability to dynamically create, update, and delete DOM elements.
- **User Interaction**: Learned how to create an engaging and interactive user experience with drag-and-drop functionality.

Feel free to explore the project and see how this mini Trello-like application works. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome! 😊
